            <p>
                2022 has been an amazing year for movies.<br/><br/>

                Anyone who follows me on Instagram knows about my RRR obsession. RRR is a movie that was released in march 2022, and it instantly became one of my favourite films of all time. Immediately, I went to all my social media accounts and started begging everyone to watch it. My Everything Everywhere All At Once (EEAAO) experience, however, was a slightly different. <br/><br/>

                So why am I talking about RRR in an Everything Everywhere All At Once review? <br/><br/>

                <img src = "images/screenshots/eeaao1.png" class = "resize1" alt="EEAAO"/>
                <div class = "comment">
                    <em>Stephanie Hsu gives a stellar performance as the <strong>Jobu Tupaki</strong></em> .
                </div>

                <br/>
                I just finished watching EEAAO. This movie is an instant classic, just mind-blowing in the best way possible; such an insane, heart-breaking, amazing experience overall. But, this movie feels much more personal than RRR did. Unlike my experience with the former, my first thought wasn't to start promoting it everywhere, instead, I wanted it to be selfishly just mine, which is why I'm glad about the fact that no one will ever have the same experience I did when I was watching this movie. That's just mine to cherish forever. <br/><br/>

                (Now that might seem like a crazy sentence to you, but please bear with me!) <br/><br/>

                This, and I cannot emphasize it enough, does NOT mean EEAAO isn't a good movie. It's an excellent movie, one of the best movies I've ever watched. Every person to ever exist should be able to watch this movie, it deserves to be appreciated in the best way possible. <br/><br/>

                If all of this made even the tiniest bit of sense to you, we should be friends, contact me!! If not, well... maybe stay for the rest of the review if you've read this far. <br/><br/>

                <div class = "comment">
                    <em>Michelle Yeoh as one of the many versions of Evelyn Wang we see in the movie.</em>
                </div>

                <br/>
                Michelle Yeoh is an icon, but we already knew that! This movie just further proves what Hollywood should have recognized years ago: that she is the leading lady to end all other leading ladies. The entire cast gave their absolute best performances, and that's one of the major things that makes this movie an absolute masterclass. <br/><br/>

                Stephanie Hsu (she's finally being recognized yay!!) was stunning, incredible, and insane as joy, and Ke Huy Quan made me laugh and cry multiple times with his very layered, amazing performance. James Hong and Jamie lee Curtis were so wonderful in their roles too. And the Jenny Slate and Harry Schum Jr. cameos made me smile a lot. <br/><br/>

                <img src = "images/screenshots/swiss army man.png" class = "resize1" alt="EEAAO"/>
                <div class = "comment">
                    <em>Though not for everyone, <strong>Swiss Army Man (2016)</strong> was a movie I enjoyed very much.</em>
                </div>

                <br/>
                I loved <a href="#"><strong>Swiss Army Man (2016)</strong></a>, so I knew the Daniels wouldn't disappoint me, and they didn't!! This is such a well-directed and well-written movie, and it kept me completely engaged from beginning to the very end. I also can't believe this was edited by only five people, and that too on premiere pro??? Honestly, I have so much respect for them; I mean that software crashes every 15 minutes when I try to add more than 3 effects. I have no idea how they had the patience to edit this 2-hour movie. <br/><br/>

                In conclusion: Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) is the best multiversal movie, the best movie about taxes, and literally top 10 best movies of all time #toMe. I do sincerely hope it gets all the recognition it deserves in the upcoming award shows (*cough* <em>Oscars</em> *cough*).<br/><br/>

                    <em>This is a movie with so much heart, guaranteed to make you tear up.</em>
                </div>

                <br/>
                "I laughed I cried a number of times I sweat I dance I got shot I ate and I had many epiphanies" is what perfectly describes my experience while watching this movie. I will definitely be rewatching this soon. <br/><br/>

                Go watch this if you haven't. Immediately (Yes this is a threat).
